# EU_Agriculture-Python
Conduct an analysis of a dataset published by the Joint Research Centre through the European Union Data Portal, given that the dataset includes extensive trade data for 78 commodities among EU countries between 2002 and 2022, I have chosen to start with a preliminary analysis focused on a single commodity: 'Tomatoes.' This initial exploration will provide valuable insights, paving the way for a more in-depth investigation into other categories later on. This project is part of a Data Analytics course with Career Foundry, utilizing Python for insights.
# Objective
To explore the agricultural commodities within EU countries, starting from a 'tomato' commodity, perform an initial data exploration and analysis, and extract valuable insights regarding the potential for market entry from countries outside the EU.
# Data
Utilizing open-source datasets including:
- EU estimated agricultural balance sheets from the European Union Data Portal, the dataset contains annual production and consumption data for 78 agricultural commodities in each of the 27 EU member countries, covering both import and export figures within and outside European countries. The data has been provided annually since 2002. 
- Demographic indicators by region, subregion and country, annually for 1950-2100 from the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat.
- EU Countries area from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
